 So what can you do with the Raspberry Pi?
This book explores a number of things you can do with your Raspberry Pi, from controlling hardware with Python, to using it as
a media centre, or building games in Scratch. The beauty of the Raspberry Pi is that it’s just a very tiny general-purpose
computer (which may be a little slower than you’re used to for some desktop applications, but much better at some other stuff
than a regular PC), so you can do anything you could do on a regular computer with it. In addition, the Raspberry Pi has
powerful multimedia and 3D graphics capabilities, so it has the potential to be used as a games platform, and we very much hope
to see people starting to write games for it.
We think physical computing—building systems using sensors, motors, lights and microcontrollers—is something that gets
overlooked in favour of pure software projects in a lot of instances, and it’s a shame, because physical computing is massive fun.
To the extent that there’s any children’s computing movement at the moment, it’s a physical computing movement. The LOGO
turtles that represented physical computing when we were kids are now fighting robots, quadcopters or parent-sensing bedroom
doors, and we love it. However, the lack of General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) on home PCs is a real handicap for many
people getting started with robotics projects. The Raspberry Pi exposes GPIO so you can get to work straight away.
I keep being surprised by ideas the community comes up with which wouldn’t have crossed my mind in a thousand years: the
Australian school meteor-tracking project; the Boreatton Scouts in the UK and their robot, which is controlled via an
electroencephalography headset (the world’s first robot controlled by Scouting brain waves); the family who are building a robot
vacuum cleaner. And I’m a real space cadet, so reading about the people sending Raspberry Pis into near-earth orbit on rockets
and balloons gives me goosebumps.
Success for us would be another 1,000 people every year taking up Computer Science at the university level in the UK. That
would not only be beneficial for the country, the software and hardware industries, and the economy; but it would be even more
beneficial for every one of those 1,000 people, who, I hope, discover that there’s a whole world of possibilities and a great deal
